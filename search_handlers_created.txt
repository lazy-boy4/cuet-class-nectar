File internal/handlers/search_handlers.go has been created with the GlobalSearchHandler.
This handler:
- Expects a query parameter "q".
- Retrieves userID and userRole from the Gin context (set by AuthMiddleware).
- Calls the services.GlobalSearch function.
- Returns results with HTTP 200 OK.
- If the service returns partial results along with errors, it returns HTTP 207 Multi-Status with details.
- Handles errors like missing query parameter or user context issues.

Next step is to add a route for this handler in cmd/server/main.go.
