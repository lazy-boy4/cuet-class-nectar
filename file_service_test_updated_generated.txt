Placeholder test structure for file_service.go has been updated/created in internal/services/file_service_test.go.
This file now includes placeholder test cases for:
- UploadProfilePicture (success DB update, storage error, DB update error), keeping in mind that the underlying UploadFileToStorage is stubbed.
- UploadClassRoutinePDF (success with stubbed storage, not a PDF, storage error, DB save error), noting that CR authorization checks within the service would also need testing if fully active.
- GetClassRoutineByClassID (found, not found).
- DeleteClassRoutine (success, routine not found, DB delete error), also noting CR authorization.

Full implementation of these tests requires a proper mocking strategy for the Supabase client (nedpals/supabase-go) and potentially for multipart.File interactions. The generated file includes comments on these complexities.

The user should adapt these placeholder tests. For the current stubbed UploadFileToStorage, tests for UploadProfilePicture and UploadClassRoutinePDF would primarily validate the logic *around* the stubbed storage call (e.g., filename generation, DB metadata updates, error propagation).
