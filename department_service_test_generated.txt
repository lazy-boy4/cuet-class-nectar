Placeholder test structure for department_service.go has been generated in internal/services/department_service_test.go.
This file outlines various test cases for the service functions:
- CreateDepartment (success, duplicate code)
- GetAllDepartments (success, empty result)
- GetDepartmentByID (success, not found)
- UpdateDepartment (success, not found)
- DeleteDepartment (success, not found/idempotency)

Full implementation of these tests requires a proper mocking strategy for the Supabase client (nedpals/supabase-go), which is complex and not fully implemented in this step. The generated file includes comments and conceptual notes on how mocking could be approached.

The user should adapt these placeholder tests with a suitable mocking framework or by running them against a dedicated test Supabase instance to ensure the service logic is validated correctly.
