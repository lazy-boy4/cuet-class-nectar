Placeholder test structure for enrollment_service.go has been generated in internal/services/enrollment_service_test.go.
This file outlines various test cases for the service functions:
- CreateEnrollmentRequest (success, already approved, already pending, re-request after rejected)
- GetEnrollmentsByStudentID (success, none found)
- ListAvailableClassesForStudent (success)
- ReviewEnrollmentRequest (CR success approve, not a CR, CR not enrolled, target not found, target not pending)
- GetPendingEnrollmentsForClass (CR success, Admin success, unauthorized user)

Full implementation of these tests requires a proper mocking strategy for the Supabase client (nedpals/supabase-go), which is complex and not fully implemented in this step. The generated file includes comments and conceptual notes on how mocking could be approached (e.g., using interfaces and a library like testify/mock).

The user should adapt these placeholder tests with a suitable mocking framework or by running them against a dedicated test Supabase instance to ensure the service logic is validated correctly.
