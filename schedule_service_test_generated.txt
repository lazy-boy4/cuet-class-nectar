Placeholder test structure for schedule_service.go has been generated in internal/services/schedule_service_test.go.
This file outlines various test cases for the service functions:
- CreateScheduleEntry (success, unauthorized CR, duplicate entry)
- GetScheduleByClassID (success, empty result)
- UpdateScheduleEntry (success, unauthorized, not found, event doesn't belong to CR's class context)
- DeleteScheduleEntry (success, unauthorized, not found)

Full implementation of these tests requires a proper mocking strategy for the Supabase client (nedpals/supabase-go). The generated file includes comments and conceptual notes on how mocking could be approached, particularly for the isCRForClass helper and subsequent DB operations.

The user should adapt these placeholder tests with a suitable mocking framework or by running them against a dedicated test Supabase instance to ensure the service logic (including authorization checks) is validated correctly.
