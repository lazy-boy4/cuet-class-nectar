Placeholder test structure for attendance_service.go has been generated in internal/services/attendance_service_test.go.
This file outlines various test cases for the service functions:
- UpsertAttendanceRecords (new records, updating existing, empty input, DB errors)
- GetAttendanceByClassAndDate (success with data, no records found)
- GetAttendanceForStudentInClass (success)

Full implementation of these tests requires a proper mocking strategy for the Supabase client (nedpals/supabase-go). The generated file includes comments and conceptual notes on how mocking could be approached. One test case for empty input in UpsertAttendanceRecords includes basic error checking without a full mock.

The user should adapt these placeholder tests with a suitable mocking framework or by running them against a dedicated test Supabase instance to ensure the service logic is validated correctly.
