File internal/services/search_service.go has been created with the GlobalSearch service.
File internal/models/search.go has been created with SearchResultItem and SearchResults models.

The GlobalSearch service performs ILIKE searches across:
- Users (full_name, email, student_id)
- Courses (code, name)
- Classes (code, session, section)
- Departments (code, name)
- Notices (content)
- Class Events (title, description)

It uses .Or() for most multi-column searches and .Filter() for single-column 'content' search in notices.
Limit(10) is applied to each entity type.
RLS policies are assumed to handle data visibility.
N+1 queries exist for enriching results (e.g., class codes for notices/events).
Errors from individual entity searches are collected and returned along with any partial results.

Next steps would be to create a handler and a route for this global search functionality.
