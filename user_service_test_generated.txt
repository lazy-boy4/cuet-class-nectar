Placeholder test structure for user_service.go has been generated in internal/services/user_service_test.go.
This file outlines various test cases for the service functions:
- PromoteStudentToCR (success, user not found, user not a student)
- DemoteCRToStudent (success, user not a CR)
- UpdateOwnUserProfile (success, no fields to update)
- AdminCreateUser (testing the stubbed error response)
- AdminDeleteUser (testing the stubbed error response)
- GetUserRole (success, user not found)
- Placeholders for GetAllUsers, GetUserByIDByAdmin.

Full implementation of these tests requires a proper mocking strategy for the Supabase client (nedpals/supabase-go), which is complex and not fully implemented in this step. The generated file includes comments and conceptual notes on how mocking could be approached (e.g., using interfaces and a library like testify/mock).

The user should adapt these placeholder tests with a suitable mocking framework or by running them against a dedicated test Supabase instance to ensure the service logic is validated correctly. The tests for stubbed functions are designed to ensure these functions correctly indicate they are not implemented due to library limitations.
