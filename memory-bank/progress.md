# Project Progress - CUET ClassNectar

## Current Status (as of latest analysis)
- **Frontend Setup**: Structure established with React, TypeScript, Vite, and ShadCN components.
- **Backend Transition**: Shifted focus to Pocketbase for backend, database, and authentication, moving away from Golang and Supabase.
- **Integration**: No backend integration yet; immediate priority is Pocketbase setup and frontend connection.
- **UI Development**: Core components under development, ensuring adaptability for Pocketbase data.
- **Features**: Detailed requirements for class management, attendance tracking, and role-based access (admin, teacher, student) outlined in project brief.

## Development Roadmap
1. **Pocketbase Setup & Configuration**: Install Pocketbase locally, define collections (schemas) for users, departments, courses, classes, and notices, and configure access rules.
2. **Frontend Integration**: Install Pocketbase JS SDK, create a service wrapper for API interactions, and update authentication flows for signup and login.
3. **Core UI Development**: Continue building UI components with ShadCN, ensuring they interact with Pocketbase data.
4. **Feature Implementation**: Develop role-based routing and specific features for admin (user management, bulk upload), teacher (class management, attendance), and student (dashboard, enrollment) roles.
5. **Quality Assurance**: Add testing for components and implement error monitoring tools like Sentry.
6. **Deployment**: Dockerize the application, set up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions), and deploy to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS or Vercel).
