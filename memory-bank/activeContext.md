# Active Context - CUET ClassNectar

## Current Focus
**Initializing Project Infrastructure**
- Memory bank structure created and populated with foundational documents
- Repository configuration complete
- Development environment prepared for feature implementation

## Immediate Priorities
1. Authentication System Implementation
   - Create auth context provider
   - Implement JWT-based authentication scaffolding
   - Prepare for role-based access control

2. Core UI Component Development
   - Begin implementing key UI components
   - Establish component library patterns
   - Ensure consistency with design system

3. Development Workflow Setup
   - Finalize TypeScript configuration
   - Ensure proper linting and code formatting
   - Prepare for component testing

## Current Constraints
- **Authentication:** No actual authentication mechanism implemented yet (current implementation uses mock data)
- **API Integration:** All data is currently mocked (no real backend connection)
- **State Management:** Basic structure in place, will evolve as features are added
- **UI Components:** Minimal implementation, will expand as needed

## Technical Considerations
1. The project is currently in initialization phase
2. No real user data is being handled
3. All API calls are mocked
4. Security considerations will be implemented in next phase

## Key Decisions
1. Using React with TypeScript as frontend framework
2. Vite as build tool
3. Tailwind CSS for styling
4. ShadCN/UI-inspired component library pattern
5. Role-based access control as core security pattern

## Pending Implementation Tasks
1. Set up auth context and state management
2. Implement login system UI
3. Create reusable UI components
4. Begin integrating mock data with components

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Incomplete technical foundation | Medium | Regular progress reviews, documentation updates |
| Misalignment with user needs | Medium | Close collaboration with stakeholders, iterative development |
| Technical debt accumulation | Medium | Continuous code quality checks, periodic refactoring |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low (currently in dev) | Planned security implementation in next phase |

## Decision Log
**Date:** 2025-05-23  
**Decision:** Use ShadCN/UI-inspired component library pattern  
**Rationale:**  
- Provides clear component organization
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Billed as a headless implementation, allowing flexibility
- Follows established design system patterns

**Date:** 2025-05-23  
**Decision:** Start with client-side authentication pattern  
**Rationale:**  
- Allows implementation of role-based UI patterns
- Prepares for eventual real authentication
- Facilitates testing and development
- Can be enhanced with real JWT implementation later
